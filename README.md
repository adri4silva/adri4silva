## Hi there, my name is Adrián 👋

I'm an iOS specialist with over 5 years of profesional experience (the last 3 working fully remote), both in large teams of +25 iOS developers and small teams of 2 contributors.

I'm focused on testing-oriented methodologies such as TDD or BDD, also in paradigms such as FP or FRP.

I have broad experience using RxSwift, ReactiveSwift, Combine and SwiftUI with architectures such as MVVM, Redux, or TCA.

I prefer to work using agile methodologies such as SCRUM and Kanban, and I enjoy building products from scratch.
