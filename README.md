### Hi there, my name is AdriÃ¡n ðŸ‘‹

I'm an iOS developer currently working remotely from Spain. My passions, when it comes to software development are: functional programming, software architecture and product design. I've been developing iOS apps professionally for almost three years, mostly using reactive frameworks and programmatic UI interfaces.

### Experience

- ðŸš• Iâ€™m currently working on FREE NOW as an iOS developer for the driver app. We try to create the best tools for the drivers, so they can work efficiently.
- ðŸ“± In the past, I worked at Quobis as an iOS developer. There we built communication tools based in Google's WebRTC library.
